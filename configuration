Here are the steps you take to configure your infrastructure

  1. Write configuration 
      $ mkdir learn-terraform-aws-instance
      $ cd learn-terraform-aws-instance
      $ touch main.tf => use the code from the attached "main.tf" and content to the file 
      
  2. Enter the following commands: 
      $ terraform init =>  to initialize the directory
      $ terraform fmt && terraform validate => to format and validate the configuration 
      $ terraform apply => to create the infrastructure
      $ terraform show => to verify 
      $ terraform state list => to display a list of resources in your current project
